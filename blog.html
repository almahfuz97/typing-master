                            <strong>Session Storage:</strong>

                            The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage
                            object for the current origin. SessionStorage is similar to localStorage but the difference
                            is
                            that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the
                            page session ends. <br> <br>

                            Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets
                            created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for that
                            particular tab. <br>

                            <br>
                            <strong>Local Storage:</strong>
                            The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage
                            object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. <br>
                            <br>
                            localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has no
                            expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when
                            the page is closed. (localStorage data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or
                            "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.)

                            <div class="accordion-body"> <strong>Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of
                                any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
                                Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                                function or conditional state can access that variable. <br> <br>

                                <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block
                                scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now,
                                these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You
                                are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                                <div class="accordion-body">The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s
                                    asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a
                                    few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be
                                    executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack and
                                    the event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for
                                    processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in
                                    which all operations should be sent for execution. All these processes are done by
                                    event loop.<br><br>

                                    The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the
                                    call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue.
                                    If it is not, then the current function call is processed.
